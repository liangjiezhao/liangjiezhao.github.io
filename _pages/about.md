My name is Zhao Liangjie (Peter). I am currently a Master’s student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and am in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program. My research focuses on multimodal large models, particularly improving post-training methods using reinforcement learning and applying RL to solve challenges in multimodal reasoning.
